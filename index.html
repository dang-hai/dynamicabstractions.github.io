            For centuries, humans have invented new representations such as symbolic notations and diagrams to externalize our thoughts and use them to conceive and develop powerful abstractions. 
          </p>
          <p class="right-aligned">
            These tools us have not only enabled us to solve complex problems but also to understand and communicate intricate concepts.
          </p>
          <p class="left-aligned">
            In this process, our cognition engages in a dynamic and multifaceted interplay of various abstractions, <strong>necessitating a blend of various representations to be <i>fully utilized</i></strong>.
          </p>
          <p class="right-aligned">
            For example, dynamic representations, capable of morphing into diverse forms –– as seen in recent works like embodied maths and reactive AR visualizations –– demonstrate such potential.
             <!-- for tapping into our latent cognitive capabilities. -->
          </p>
          <p class="left-aligned">
            Historically, however, the <strong>lack of dynamic mediums and technologies</strong> has confined our experiences to static representations and tools.
          </p>
          <p class="right-aligned">
            We believe AI offers an opportunity for us to address this gap and develop <strong>dynamic representations and tools</strong> that can adapt to and augment diverse aspects of our cognition.

            While powerful, the creation and modification of dynamic representations pose significant challenges for creators in art, science, and other domains with today's technology due to a lack of adequate tools and research to support the design, creation, and presentation processes.

          <p>As AI opens up new possibilities, we should explore new forms of interactions and interfaces that go beyond our traditional ways.

              <li>It will enable creators to create & modify dynamic representations / notations spontaneously.</li>
              <li>It will facilitates more powerful ways of thinking to creators, by navigating between different abstractions & modalities.</li>
