            For centuries, the invention of new representations such as symbolic notations and diagrams has unveiled latent cognitive capabilities within us and elevated our capacity to grasp, comprehend, and articulate complex concepts. However, although our cognitive processes, comprising multifaceted interplays of different capabilities, demand a blend of various representations, the limitations of static mediums in facilitating this blending have left this space underexplored and hindered the expansion of our cognition. Nevertheless, the advancements in digital technologies and AI suggest this is an opportune time for progress. Dynamic representations, capable of morphing into diverse forms --- as seen in recent works like embodied maths and reactive AR visualizations --- alongside the progress in AI facilitating representation transformation, can help us develop interactive systems and media that advance our cognition and support varying tasks. We aim to bridge this gap and advance this field by fostering a community for individuals interested in this topic to connect, collaborate, and learn through discourse and the sharing of relevant resources.

            While powerful, the creation and modification of dynamic representations pose significant challenges for creators in art, science, and other domains with today's technology due to a lack of adequate tools and research to support the design, creation, and presentation processes.
