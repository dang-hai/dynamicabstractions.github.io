          <p class="left-aligned">
            For centuries, humans have invented new representations such as languages, notations, and diagrams to externalize our thoughts and use them to conceive and develop <strong>powerful abstractions</strong>.
          </p>
          <p class="right-aligned">
            They have enabled us to discover solutions to complex problems and to grasp and articulate ideas of immense complexity. 
          </p>
          <p class="left-aligned">
            Historically, however, the <strong>limitations of <i>static</i> mediums</strong> have restricted our experiences and constrained our minds to static representations and tools.
          </p>
          <p class="right-aligned">
            We argue that this confinement results in the <strong>underutilization of our cognitive capabilities and potential</strong>, as they entrap us within their <i>fixed</i> boundaries and functionalities, misaligning with the inherently dynamic nature of the huamn mind.
          </p>
          <p class="left-aligned">
            With AI and dynamic mediums, we can now develop <strong>dynamic representations and tools</strong> –– as seen in recent works like embodied maths and reactive AR visualizations –– that enable us to think, create, and communicate in more powerful ways.
          </p>
          <p class="center-aligned">
            This working group is committed to bridging this gap and propelling us into the next chapter.
