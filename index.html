            For centuries, humans have invented new representations such as languages, notations, and diagrams to externalize our thoughts and use them to conceive and develop powerful abstractions. 
          </p>
          <p class="right-aligned">
            They have enabled us to discover solutions to complex problems and to grasp and articulate ideas of immense complexity. 
          </p>
          <p class="left-aligned">
            Historically, however, the limitations of static mediums have restricted our experiences and constrained our minds to static representations and tools.
          </p>
          <p class="right-aligned">
            We argue that this confinement has led to the underutilization of our cognitive capabilities and potential, as static mediums and representations entrap us within their <i>fixed</i> boundaries and functionalities, misaligning with the inherently dynamic nature of the huamn mind.
          </p>
          <p class="left-aligned">
            With AI and dynamic mediums, we can now develop <strong>dynamic representations and tools</strong> –– as seen in recent works like embodied maths and reactive AR visualizations –– that enable us to think, create, and communicate in more powerful and effective ways.
          </p>
          <p class="right-aligned">
            This working group is committed to bridging this gap and propelling us into the next chapter of human history.
